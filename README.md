Minimum Spanning Tree Using Prim's Algorithm
--------------------------------------------------
This C++ program demonstrates Prim's Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted, undirected graph.

The program uses an adjacency matrix to represent the graph and provides functionalities to input graph data, display the graph, and compute the MST.

Features:
------------------------
Input: Allows the user to enter the number of branches (nodes) and connections (edges) along with the weights (costs) of the edges.

Display: Outputs the adjacency matrix of the graph, showing the weights of the connections between nodes.

Minimum: Computes and displays the Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm, showing the minimum cost connections and the total cost of the MST.

How It Works:
----------------------
Input Function:
------------------
Prompts the user to enter the number of branches and connections.

Collects the end branches and weights for each connection and populates the adjacency matrix.

Display Function:
--------------------------
Prints the adjacency matrix to the console.

Minimum Function:
-------------------
Implements Prim's Algorithm to find the MST.

Displays each selected edge with its weight and calculates the total minimum cost.
Displays each selected edge with its weight and calculates the total minimum cost.
